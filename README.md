# Introduction-to-Numpy
Arrays are a special type of list that allows us to store values in an organized manner. An array can be created by either defining it directly using np.array() or by importing a CSV using np.genfromtxt('file.csv', delimiter=','). An operation (such as addition) can be performed on every element in an array by simply performing it on the array itself. Elements can be selected from arrays using their index and array locations, both of which start at 0. Logical operations can be used to create new, more focused arrays out of larger arrays.
